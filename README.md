# p2f
particle to distribution function

The two example cases have "real" Maxwellian distrubtions, i.e., more particles at the thermal velocity rather than a uniform velocity space grid and variable weight.

These sample particle lists (the "f.nc" files) are created using an [IDL script](https://github.com/dlg0/sMC/blob/smc_cpp/idl/create_test_particle_f.pro) available in the sMC repository using the following command 

```
IDL> create_test_particle_f, /standard_maxwellian_3d, energy_keV=0.5, n_particles=10000, eqdsk='eqdsk', density_m3=1e13, Z=1.0, amu=1.0
```

This will create a uniform (flat) density / uniform temperature (Maxwellian) particle list with vTh=sqrt(3kT/m)

There are 3 smoothing options that p2f provides ...


* No smoothing at all, i.e., just a histogram.
```
DistributeAlongOrbit = .false.
gParticle = .false.
```

```

TookMaxStepsBeforeBounce:       0.00%
   *** this means you need a larger MaxSteps

```
We can then run the IDL post processing script to look at the result
```
IDL>plot_p2f
Total number of particles :   9.05868e+12

* Distribute a particle along its guiding center orbit according to how long it spends in each velocity space bin
```

The number of total particles is LOWER here by the 4.69% that were lost due to their orbits going outside the LCFS, i.e., they should never have really been in the particle list in the first place.
